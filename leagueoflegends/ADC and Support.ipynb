    "<a href=\"https://play.na.leagueoflegends.com/en_US\">League of Legends</a> (abbreviated LoL) is a multiplayer online battle arena video game developed and published by Riot Games. The game is available on both Windows and macOS platforms. Released on October 27, 2009,League of Legends has since grown in popularity, with an active and expansive fanbase. In September 2016, the company estimated that there are over 100 million active players each month. LoL also has a professional league. The top prize for the best team is over five million dollars and the average player makes a six-figure income.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/lol lines.png\" class=\"inline\"/> \n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of the game is to defeat the enemy team by destroying its nexus, which lies in the enemy base. There are two teams in each game: the blue team and the red team, who have 5 players each. Each player will select a champion from 142 available champions, each with a unique set of abilities, to play before the game begin. They will then collaborate together to defense against the enemy's attack. The game ends by either one team destroying the enemy team’s nexus, or one team surrenders. \n",
    "\n",
    "The map, which is known as “Summoner’s Rift”, is divided into two sides by a diagonal line, known as the “river”. The blue team’s territory lies under the river, and the red team’s territory is above it. The yellow paths, known as “lanes”, are guarded by defensive structures, known as “turrets”, and automatically created characters known as “minions”. The lanes are called “top”, “middle” and “bottom” lanes in respect to their positions on the map. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the early phase of the game, players usually control their champion to guard a lane to level up and gain gold until they are strong enough to fight as a team. In this tutorial, we focus on the two champions guarding the bottom lane, often called “ADC” and “support”. Champions who are fitted for the “ADC” role are ranged champions that can deal high physical damage. But they also tend to have weak defense and low health, thus they are accompanied by another champion, “support”, who can provide healing, shielding, and harass the enemy champion. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we aim to clean the game statistics from all international matches since 2015, then analyze the dataset to gain insight on the relationship between bottom lane champion combination and victories. We want to use hypothesis testing to prove the correlation between two factors, and then use regression analysis to predict wins or loses based on champion combinations. \n"
